## 0.1 Introduction to basic knowledge

Vector databases are a special type of database that use mathematical vectors to represent and store data. This is very different from traditional databases, which typically use tables and rows to organize data.

1. **Definition of vector database** üí°

     - How do vector databases work?

         In a vector database, data is stored and processed in the form of vectors, so the original non-vector data needs to be converted into vector representation. Data vectorization refers to the process of converting non-vector data into vector form. Through data vectorization, efficient similarity calculation and query in vector database are realized. In addition, vector databases use different retrieval algorithms to speed up vector similarity searches, such as `KD-Tree`, `VP-Tree`, `LSH` and `Inverted Index`, etc. In practical applications, algorithm selection and parameter tuning need to be carried out according to specific scenarios. The specific algorithm chosen depends on the characteristics of the data set, data volume and query requirements, as well as the requirements for search accuracy and efficiency.

     - How do they use vectors to store and process data?

         Vector databases use mathematical vectors to store and process data, which is significantly different from traditional database storage methods. Key steps and concepts here include:

         1. **Convert data to vector** üîÑ
             - In a vector database, data is first converted into the form of mathematical vectors. For example, text data can be converted into vectors through natural language processing techniques, and image data can be converted into vectors through deep learning models.
         2. **Vector representation** üìà
             - Each data item is represented as a vector, which has its specific position and direction in multidimensional space. These vectors are usually in a high-dimensional space, with each dimension representing a feature of the data.
         3. **similarity search** üîç
             - A key feature of vector databases is similarity search. It finds similar items by comparing the distance between vectors of data items (for example, using cosine similarity). This is particularly effective for processing complex queries and large data sets.
         4. **Indexing and retrieval** üìö
             - Vector databases use efficient indexing mechanisms to quickly retrieve and access data. These indexes help the database quickly locate the vectors involved in the query, thus speeding up searches.
         5. **Machine Learning Integration** ü§ñ
             - Many vector databases can be tightly integrated with machine learning models. This allows the database to not only store data, but also directly process and analyze data through models, thereby providing more advanced data processing and analysis capabilities.

         By using vectors to represent and process data, vector databases are able to handle more complex and richer data types while providing faster search and retrieval performance. This makes them increasingly important in today‚Äôs data-driven world.

2. **Comparison with traditional database** üìä

     - What are the differences in structure and function between vector databases and traditional databases?
         1. **Data storage method** üóÑÔ∏è
             - **Traditional Database**: Typically stores data in the form of rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. This structure is ideal for storing structured data such as text and numbers.
             - **Vector Database**: Use mathematical vectors to represent data. Each data point is a vector that can be represented in a high-dimensional space. This method is suitable for storing unstructured data such as images, audio and text.
         2. **Query and Search** üîç
             - **Traditional database**: Focus on precise queries, such as searching by specific keywords or numerical values.
             - **Vector Database**: Good at fuzzy or similarity searches. For example, you can find images that are similar to a given image, or find semantically similar text.
         3. **Performance and Optimization** üöÄ
             - **Traditional database**: Excellent performance when processing large amounts of structured queries.
             - **Vector Database**: Specially optimized for handling complex similarity searches, which is very efficient for large-scale unstructured data.
     - In what situations is it more appropriate to use a vector database?
         1. **Unstructured Data Processing** üñºÔ∏è
             - When the data is unstructured, such as images, videos, or natural language text, vector databases can store and retrieve this data more efficiently.
         2. **Complex Similarity Search** üîé
             - When complex similarity searches need to be performed, such as recommendation systems or pattern recognition, vector databases provide a more efficient solution.
         3. **Big Data Application** üíæ
             - Vector databases are ideal for applications that require processing and analyzing large data sets, especially those that require fast and efficient search capabilities.
         4. **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence** ü§ñ
             - The integration of vector databases with the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, making them excellent at processing data from these fields.

3. **Vector Database & AI**

     - Why are vector databases important for AI?

         Because it has inherent advantages in processing high-dimensional data, from image processing to recommendation systems, vector databases are undoubtedly the heroes behind the scenes. Its main functions include:

         - Management: The vector database processes data in the form of raw data and can effectively organize and manage data to facilitate the application of AI models.
         - Storage: Able to store vector data, including high-dimensional data required by various AI models.
         - Retrieval: Vector databases are particularly good at retrieving data efficiently. This feature ensures that the AI model can quickly obtain the data it needs when it is needed. This is also an important reason why vector databases can be used in some recommendation systems or retrieval systems.

         Therefore, we say that the vector database allows AI to have memory. This memory is not only record storage, but also retrieval and management. Just like human memory, we can always recognize who this person is through the graduation photos of our classmates; we often reminisce about the past together when chatting with friends.

     - **Vector Database**: In a vector database, data is typically represented as vectors, which are indexed and retrieved in the database for efficient similarity searches.

## **0.3 Introduction to Linear Algebra: Vector Operations**

### **Vector addition üîÑ**

- **Concept**: Vector addition is adding the corresponding elements of two vectors.
- **Example**: If v1 = [1, 2, 3] and v2 = [4, 5, 6], then their sum is [1+4, 2+5, 3+6] = [5, 7, 9].
- **Geometry Meaning**: Geometrically, vector addition can be viewed as placing the tail of one vector at the head of another vector, and then forming a new vector.

### **Vector subtraction ‚ûñ**

- **Concept**: Vector subtraction is subtracting the corresponding elements of one vector from another vector.
- **Example**: If v1 = [4, 5, 6] and v2 = [1, 2, 3], then their difference is [4-1, 5-2, 6-3] = [3, 3, 3].
- **Geometry Meaning**: Geometrically, vector subtraction can be viewed as going from the head of one vector to the head of another vector.

### **Dot product (inner product) ‚ö´**

- **Concept**: Dot multiplication is to multiply the corresponding elements of two vectors and then add the results.

- **Formula**: If v1 = [a1, a2, a3] and v2 = [b1, b2, b3], then their dot product is a1*b1 + a2*b2 + a3*b3.

- **Example**: For v1 = [1, 2, 3] and v2 = [4, 5, 6], the dot product result is 1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6 = 32.

- **Geometric meaning**: The dot product can be expressed geometrically as a function of the angle between two vectors. If the dot product is zero, then the two vectors are perpendicular.

- ****Calculation skills of dot product (inner product)****

     **Direct Calculation Method**

     - **Method**: Multiply the corresponding elements of two vectors and add the results.
     - **Example**: For v1 = [a1, a2, a3] and v2 = [b1, b2, b3], the dot product is a1*b1 + a2*b2 + a3*b3.

     **Using the Cosine Theorem**

     - **Background**: Dot product can be used to calculate the angle between two vectors.
     - **Formula**: If |v1| and |v2| are the lengths of two vectors respectively, and Œ∏ is the angle between them, then the dot product v1¬∑v2 = |v1|* |v2|* cos(Œ∏ ).- **Application**: This method is particularly useful when determining whether two vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular), because if cos(Œ∏) = 0, the dot product results in zero.

     **Using matrix multiplication**

     - **Method**: Treat one vector as a 1√ón matrix and the other as an n√ó1 matrix, then do matrix multiplication.
     - **Example**: Treat v1 = [1, 2, 3] as a 1√ó3 matrix and v2 = [4, 5, 6] as a 3√ó1 matrix. Their matrix multiplication results are dot products. result.

     **Implementation in Programming**

     - **Python code example**:

         ```python
         def dot_product(v1, v2):
             return sum(x*y for x, y in zip(v1, v2))
         ```

     - **DESCRIPTION**: This function pairs the elements of two vectors via the **`zip`** function, then calculates the product of the elements of each pair and adds them.

     **Geometry Applications**

     - **Projection**: The dot product can be used to calculate the length of the projection of one vector onto another vector.
     - **Angle calculation**: Through dot product and vector length, the angle between two vectors can be calculated.

## **0.4 similarity measure: cosine similarity**

### **What is cosine similarity? **

- **Definition**: Cosine similarity is a measure of how similar two vectors are in direction, regardless of their size.
- **Calculation method**: Calculated by measuring the cosine of the angle between two vectors. The closer the cosine value is to 1, the more similar the two vectors are.

### **How to calculate cosine similarity? **

1. **Formula**:

     - Cosine similarity is defined as the dot product of two vectors A and B divided by the product of their respective lengths.
     - Formula: `cos(Œ∏) = (A¬∑B) / (||A||*||B||)`
     - Where A¬∑B represents the dot product of A and B, `||A||` and `||B||` are the Euclidean lengths (or norms) of vectors A and B, which means ** The straight-line distance from the origin to its endpoints. **

2. **Calculation steps**:

     - Computes the dot product of two vectors.
     - Calculate the length (or module) of each vector separately.
     - Divide the dot product by the product of the two lengths.

3. **Python code example**:

     ```python
     import math
    
     def cosine_similarity(v1, v2):
         dot_product = sum(a*b for a, b in zip(v1, v2))
         magnitude_v1 = math.sqrt(sum(a*a for a in v1))
         magnitude_v2 = math.sqrt(sum(b*b for b in v2))
         return dot_product / (magnitude_v1 * magnitude_v2)
    
     ```

### **Application of cosine similarity**

### **How indexes work**

- **Storage Structure**: Most database indexes, such as B-trees (especially B+ trees), optimize data retrieval through specific data structures.
- **Query Optimization**: When performing query operations, the database can use indexes to quickly locate data instead of scanning the entire table row by row.

### **Index in vector database**

- **Speciality**: In vector databases, the establishment and use of indexes are different from traditional databases because they deal with high-dimensional vector data.
- **Approximate Search**: Indexes in vector databases are typically designed for fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) searches. This means they can quickly find the data points that are most similar to the query vector.
- **Indexing technology**: For example, use techniques such as KD trees, ball trees, or product quantification to effectively organize and retrieve high-dimensional data.

### **Index optimization and challenges**

- **Balance**: When implementing indexes, a balance needs to be found between query performance and index maintenance costs.
- **Update**: When the database table is updated, the index needs to be updated accordingly, which can be a time-consuming operation.
- **Space Requirements**: Indexes require additional storage space.

**Some questions üîï**

- How are different data dimensions controlled & why use high-latitude data?

     First of all, we know how dimensions are defined. Human beings live in three dimensions, **three-dimensional space** (also known as **three-dimensional space**, **three-dimensional**, **3D**). In daily life, we can Refers to the space composed of three dimensions: length, width and height, and often refers to the three-dimensional [Euclidean space] (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AC% A7%E5%87%A0%E9%87%8C%E5%BE%97%E7%A9%BA%E9%97%B4). Some people also say that time should be added to our current space, so it is called **four-dimensional space-time**.

     **The meaning of dimensions in large language models and vector databases**

     1. **Definition of dimensions**:
         - In large language models and vector databases, "dimension" refers to the number of features of a data point. Each dimension represents a specific aspect or attribute of the data.
     2. **High-dimensional data**:
         - When data points contain a large number of features, we say that the data is high-dimensional. For example, a word vector may have hundreds or thousands of dimensions, each encoding some linguistic or semantic information.
         - In deep learning, layers of a model may generate high-dimensional feature spaces to represent complex patterns and relationships.
     3. **Low-dimensional data**:
         - In contrast, if a data point has only a few features, we call it low-dimensional. For example, a simple data set might contain only a few dimensions, such as length, width, and height.

     **Why use high-dimensional data? **

     1. **Information-rich**:
         - High-dimensional data can contain richer information. In language models, high-dimensional word vectors can capture more subtle semantic and linguistic differences.
     2. **Capture Complexity**:
         - Complex patterns and relationships often require more dimensions to accurately represent. In machine learning, high-dimensional feature spaces allow models to learn and represent complex input data structures.

     **How to control and process high-dimensional data? **

     1. **Dimensionality reduction technology**:
         - Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or t-SNE are used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining important information as much as possible.
         - This helps simplify model and data visualization.
     2. **Efficient Algorithm**:
         - For high-dimensional data, specific efficient algorithms are developed, such as the approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm, to improve computational efficiency without sacrificing too much accuracy.

- Why do vector databases typically use the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search algorithm instead of other methods like the "Approximate Depth Algorithm"?

     **The Reason for Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search**

     1. **Challenges of high-dimensional data**:
         - Vector databases are often used to process high-dimensional data, such as those generated by deep learning models.
         - In high-dimensional spaces, traditional depth searches (such as depth-first searches) are inefficient because they require traversing a large portion of the data set to find the nearest neighbor.
     2. **"Curse of Dimension"**:
         - As the dimension increases, the distance between any two points becomes more and more similar (this is called "[wiki: Curse of Dimension](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BB% B4%E6%95%B0%E7%81%BE%E9%9A%BE)‚Äù).
         - In this case, finding the nearest neighbor exactly becomes impractical, so approximate methods are more efficient.
     3. **Balance between speed and accuracy**:
         - ANN search provides an efficient balance between speed and accuracy.
         - It allows returning "good enough" results within an acceptable time, which is crucial for large-scale real-time applications.

     **Why not "approximate depth algorithm"? **

     - **Limitations of deep search**:
         - Deep search methods (such as depth-first search) work better in low-dimensional data or specific types of structured data.
         - For randomly distributed high-dimensional data, deep search may incur huge performance overhead because it may require traversing the entire data set to find an approximately optimal solution.
     - **Differences in search types**:
         - Deep search is not directly related to the concepts of "approximation" or "nearest neighbor". It focuses more on traversing deeply within a data structure (like a graph or a tree) rather than finding the closest data point.

- What problems will the increase in dimensionality bring?

     Often referred to as the "Curse of Dimensionality" in the fields of data science and machine learning, it brings a series of problems and challenges.

     **Main problems caused by the curse of dimensionality**

     1. **Data Sparsity**
         - In high-dimensional space, data points may be very scattered, resulting in "empty space" around each data point. This makes analysis based on proximity points, such as clustering or nearest neighbor searches, difficult. (imagine 2D to 3D)
     2. **Insufficient sample coverage**
         - As the dimensionality increases, the required sample size increases exponentially to maintain data density. In practical applications, it is difficult to obtain a sufficient number of samples to cover high-dimensional space.
     3. **Computational complexity increases**
         - In high-dimensional space, the computational cost of many algorithms (especially distance-based algorithms) will increase significantly, resulting in reduced efficiency.
     4. **Difficulty of Dimensionality Reduction**
         - Although dimensionality reduction techniques (such as PCA) can help alleviate the curse of dimensionality, important information may be lost during the dimensionality reduction process, and dimensionality reduction itself is a challenge. (Think of a two-way foil)
     5. **Model overfitting**
         - In high-dimensional spaces, models are more likely to overfit, especially when the number of samples is small relative to the number of features. This means that a model may perform well on training data but perform poorly on new, unseen data.
     6. **Distance measure invalid**
         - In high-dimensional spaces, traditional distance measures (such as Euclidean distance) may fail because the distance differences between different points become tiny.

     **Strategies for solving the Curse of Dimension**

     1. **Dimensionality reduction technology**
         - Use dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE to reduce the number of features while retaining important information as much as possible.
     2. **Feature Selection**
         - Retain only the most important features through feature selection methods to reduce dimensionality.
     3. **Increase sample size**
         - Increase data sample size as much as possible to improve data coverage in high-dimensional space.
     4. **Use specific algorithm**
         - On high-dimensional data, use those algorithms designed specifically for high dimensions, such as tree-based methods or locality-sensitive hashing.

## **1.4 Integrated Machine Learning**

### What is machine learning?

Machine learning is a technology that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions or predictions. It is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that allow computers to automatically improve their performance based on data provided.

### Core features:

1. **Automatic Learning**:
     - Computer systems improve their performance by analyzing and learning from data, rather than through explicit programming.
2. **Pattern Recognition**:
     - Machine learning models are able to identify complex patterns and relationships that may be difficult for humans to see or understand.
3. **Forecasting and Decision Making**:
     - Based on historical data, models can make predictions or make decisions, such as recommendation systems, stock price predictions, etc.

### **What is a machine learning model? **

A machine learning model is the result of learning from data through a machine learning algorithm. It is a mathematical representation of the data pattern. Simply put, a model is an abstraction of data used for prediction or decision-making.

### Build process:

1. **Training**:
     - Use large amounts of data and algorithms to "train" the model so that it can recognize patterns and relationships in the data.
     - The training process involves adjusting model parameters to minimize prediction errors.
2. **Verification and Testing**:
     - Validate and test the model using data not involved in training to ensure its accuracy and generalization ability.
3. **Application**:
     - The trained model can then be applied to new data for prediction or decision support.

### type:

- **Supervised Learning**: Models learn based on labeled training data, such as classification and regression tasks.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Models look for patterns on unlabeled data, such as clustering and association rule learning.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns strategies to achieve goals through interaction with the environment.

Feature vectors generated by machine learning models are a very important concept, especially in the fields of deep learning and natural language processing. These feature vectors are able to capture and represent complex patterns and characteristics of the data, allowing us to conduct deeper analysis and more efficient data processing. üîçü§ñ

### How to integrate machine learning

In the supervised learning algorithm of machine learning, our goal is to learn a stable model that performs well in all aspects, but the actual situation is often not so ideal, and sometimes we can only get multiple preferred models ( Weakly supervised models perform better in some aspects). Ensemble learning is to combine multiple weak supervision models here in order to obtain a better and more comprehensive strong supervision model. The underlying idea of ensemble learning is that even if a certain weak classifier gets an incorrect prediction, other weak classifiers can also correct the error. Correct back.

- Ensemble methods are meta-algorithms that combine several machine learning techniques into a predictive model to achieve the effect of reducing variance (bagging), bias (boosting), or improving prediction (stacking).

- Ensemble learning has good strategies on data sets of all sizes.

- Large data set: Divide it into multiple small data sets and learn multiple models for combination

- Small data set: Use the `Bootstrap` method for sampling to obtain multiple data sets, train multiple models separately and then combine them

     - Bootstrap sampling method

         In **statistics**, **Bootstrap Method** (Bootstrap Method, Bootstrapping, or **Bootstrap Sampling Method**, **Boot Pulling Method**) is a method with replacement from a given training set. Uniform sampling, that is, whenever a sample is selected, it is equally likely to be selected again and added to the training set again. The self-help method was published by Bradley Efron in "Annals of Statistics" in 1979. When [sample](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A8%A3%E6%9C%AC_(%E7%B5%B1%E8%A8%88%E5%AD%B8)) From a population that can be described by a normal distribution , its [sampling distribution](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%8A%BD%E6%A0%B7%E5%88%86%E5%B8%83) is a normal distribution; but When the population from which the sample comes cannot be described by a normal distribution, [Asymptotic Analysis Method](https://zh.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E6%BC%B8%E9%80% B2%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90%E6%B3%95&action=edit&redlink=1), self-help method, etc. to analyze. Use random sampling with replacement. For small data sets, bootstrapping works well.

Collection methods can be divided into two categories:

- Sequential ensemble methods, where the base learners involved in training are generated sequentially (e.g. AdaBoost). The principle of the sequence method is to exploit the dependencies between basic learners. By assigning higher weights to incorrectly labeled samples in previous training, the overall prediction effect can be improved.
- Parallel ensemble methods, where the base learners involved in training are generated in parallel (e.g. Random Forest). The principle of parallel methods is to exploit the independence between basic learners, which can significantly reduce errors through averaging.

## Vector index (****Vector Index****)

**Article reference:**

[What is a Vector Index? An Introduction to Vector Indexing](https://www.datastax.com/guides/what-is-a-vector-index)

Vector index is a data structure used in computer science and information retrieval to efficiently store and retrieve high-dimensional vector data, enabling fast similarity searches and nearest neighbor queries.

The use of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) is growing at a very fast rate. Generative AI models are capable of creating realistic and interactive text, images, video and audio for a variety of problems. Companies are finding many uses for these types of AI algorithms, including building virtual assistants, new ways to search data, and tools to make people work more efficiently.

Generative AI models can be tailored to specific use cases by providing them with additional context and long-term memory. A common pattern for providing this additional context is called Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG).

For many use cases, RAG is implemented by creating a set of vector embeddings that encode semantic information that generates a dataset that will be used by AI applications, and then searching and retrieving relevant objects from that vector embedding dataset to provide Back to generate AI model.

Vector indexing is a key part of implementing RAG in generative AI applications. A vector index is a data structure that enables fast and accurate search and retrieval of vector embeddings from large object datasets. Datastax Astra DB (built on Apache Cassandra) is a vector database that provides vector indexing for fast object retrieval and efficient storage and data management for vector embedding.

In this guide, we will discuss vector indexing, how it works, its importance for generative AI applications through RAG, and how Datastax and Astra DB can help you implement vector indexing for generative AI products easily and efficiently.

****Understanding Vector Indexes****

The purpose of vector indexing is to search and retrieve data from a large collection of vectors. Why is this important for generative AI applications? Vector representations of data bring context to generative AI models.

Vector indexing allows us to easily find the specific data we are looking for among a large number of vector representations.

An embedding is a mathematical representation of data that captures the meaning of an object. Embeddings are created by taking an object and converting it into a list of numbers or a vector representation.

The resulting embeddings then place relevant content near other similar content in vector space.

****How vector indexing works****

In traditional databases and indexes, we store data as rows that represent some fact or concept, and a set of columns that describe that concept in more detail or link us to supporting tables that contain more information.

These data are scalar, which means they have only one value, rather than vector data containing multiple values.

When we query a scalar index to retrieve rows or records, we typically query for an exact match. The power of indexes that use vector embeddings to capture semantic information is that we can search for approximate matches in the index.

We provide a vector as input and ask the vector index to return other vectors similar to the input or query vector. This allows us to search large vector datasets very quickly.

The class of algorithms used to build and search vector indexes is called approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search.

The ANN algorithm relies on similarity measures to determine nearest neighbors. Vector indexes must be constructed based on a specific similarity measure. To build the vector index, we choose a similarity measure and a method of creating the index.

****Local Sensitive Hash (LSH) Index****

Locality-sensitive hashing is an indexing strategy that optimizes for speed and finding approximate nearest neighbors, rather than performing an exhaustive search to find actual nearest neighbors like flat indexing.

The index is built using a hash function. Vector embeddings that are close to each other are hashed into the same bucket. We can then store all these similar vectors in a table or bucket.

When a query vector is provided, its nearest neighbors can be found by hashing the query vector and then computing a similarity measure for all vectors in the table against all other vectors that hash to the same value.

This results in smaller searches compared to flat indexes, where the similarity measure is calculated over the entire space, greatly increasing the speed of queries.

****Inverted File (IVF) Index****

Inverted file (IVF) indexing is similar to LSH in that the goal is to first map the query vector to a smaller subset of the vector space and then search only that smaller space to obtain approximate nearest neighbors. This will greatly reduce the number of vectors we need to compare to the query vector, thus speeding up our ANN search.

In LSH, subsets of vectors are produced by hash functions. In IVF, the vector space is first partitioned or clustered, and then the centroid of each cluster is found. For a given query vector, we find the nearest centroid.
