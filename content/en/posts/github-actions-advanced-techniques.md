## Create actions

**actions are individual tasks that can be combined to create jobs and custom workflows. You can create your own actions, or use and customize actions shared by the GitHub community. **

Actions can be created by writing custom code that interacts with your repository in any way you like, including integrating with GitHub's API and any publicly available third-party API.

You can write your own actions for use in workflows, or share the actions you build with the GitHub community. To share your built actions with everyone, your repository must be public.

Operations can be run directly on the machine or in a Docker container. You can define inputs, outputs, and environment variables for an operation.

Can build Docker containers, JavaScript and composite operations. An operation requires a metadata file that defines the input, output, and main entry point of the operation. The metadata file name must be `action.yml` or `action.yaml`. For more information, see "Metadata syntax for GitHub operations."



## docker container operations

Docker containers use GitHub Actions code packaging environments. This creates a more consistent and reliable unit of work because consumers of the operation don't need to worry about tools or dependencies.

Docker containers allow you to use specific versions of operating systems, dependencies, tools, and code. Docker is ideal for operations that must run within a specific environment configuration because you can customize the operating system and tools.



## Release management for operations

If you are developing an action for use by others, we recommend using release management to control how updates are distributed.

Users can expect operational hotfix releases that include necessary critical fixes and security fixes while remaining compatible with their existing workflows. Whenever your changes affect compatibility, you should consider releasing a new major version.

Under this method of release management, users should not reference the default branch of operations because it may contain the latest code and therefore may be unstable.

Instead, you can recommend that users specify a major version when using your action, and only direct them to a more specific version if they encounter problems.

To use a specific action version, users can configure their GitHub action workflow to target a tag, a commit's SHA, or a branch named after a release.



## Use tags for release management

We recommend using tags for operational release management. Using this method, your users can easily differentiate between major and minor versions:

+ Create and verify releases on release branches (e.g. `release/v1` ) before creating release tags (e.g. `v1.0.2` ).
+ Create releases using semantic versioning
   + To the right of the file list, click **Releases**
   + At the top of the page, click **Draft New Version**.
   + To select a label for the release, select the **Select Label** drop-down menu.
   + If you created a new tag, select the **Target** dropdown and click on the branch that contains the project you want to release.
   + In the "Describe this version" field, type a description for your version. If you `@mention` anyone in the description, the published version will contain a **Contributors** section with a list of avatars of all mentioned users. Alternatively, you can automatically generate release notes by clicking Generate Release Notes.
   + Alternatively, to include binaries (such as compiled programs) in your build, drag and drop or manually select the files in the Binaries box
   + Alternatively, select **Set to latest version**. If you do not select this option, the latest version label will be automatically assigned based on semantic versioning.
   + If you are ready to publish your version, click **Publish Version**. To work on this version later, click **Save Draft**. You can then view published or draft releases in the repository's releases feed. For more information, see "Viewing your repository's releases and tags" )".
+ Move the major version tag (such as `v1`, `v2`) to point to the current version of Git ref. For example: `git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"`
+ Introducing a new major version tag (`v2`) for changes that will break existing workflows. For example, changing the input to an operation would be a breaking change.
+ Major versions may initially be released with the `beta` tag to indicate their status, e.g. `v2-beta` . The `-beta` tag can be removed when ready.

### Post form automation with query parameters

> To quickly create a publication by automatically populating a new publication form with custom information, you can add query parameters to the URL of the publication form page.

Query parameters are optional parts of the URL that you can customize to share specific web views, such as search filter results, issue templates, or publish form pages on GitHub. To create your own query parameters, you must match key-value pairs.

| Query Parameters | Examples |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------- -------------------------- |
| `tag` | `https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/releases/new?tag=v1.0.1` Creates a version based on a tag named "v1.0.1". |
| `target` | `https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/releases/new?target=release-1.0.1` Create a release based on the latest commit to the "release-1.0.1" branch . |
| `title` | `https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/releases/new?tag=v1.0.1&title=octo-1.0.1` Created based on the tag named "v1.0.1" Version named "octo-1.0.1". |
| `body` | `https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/releases/new?body=Adds+widgets+support` creates a release with the description "Add widgets support" in the body of the release release. |
| `prerelease` | `https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/releases/new?prerelease=1` creates a release that will be marked as non-production ready. |



### How to quote a version

This example demonstrates how users can reference major version tags:

```
steps:
     - uses: actions/javascript-action@v1
```

This example demonstrates how users can reference specific patch version tags:

```
steps:
     - uses: actions/javascript-action@v1.0.1
```



## Use branches for version management

If you prefer to use branch names for release management, this example shows how to reference named branches:

```yaml
steps:
     - uses: actions/javascript-action@v1-beta
```



## Use submitted SHA for release management

Each Git commit receives a calculated SHA value that is unique and immutable. Users of your action may prefer to rely on the submitted SHA value, as this approach is more reliable than specifying a label, which may be deleted or moved.

However, this means users will not receive further updates on the operation. You must use the full SHA value submitted, not the abbreviated value.

```yaml
steps:
     - uses: actions/javascript-action@a824008085750b8e136effc585c3cd6082bd575f
```



## Comparison of GitHub actions and GitHub apps

While both GitHub Actions and GitHub Apps provide ways to build automation and workflow tools, they each have strengths that make them useful in different ways.

**GitHub apps:**

- Continuous operation and rapid response to events.
- Works well when persistent data is required.
- Best for API requests that are not time consuming.
- Run on servers or computing infrastructure provided by you.

**GitHub actions:**

- Provides automation to perform continuous integration and continuous deployment.
- Can be run directly in the runner machine or Docker container.
- Can include access to clones of the repository, allowing deployment and release tools, code formatters, and command line tools to access the code.
- No need to deploy code or provision the application.
- There is a simple interface to create and use secrets, which enables actions to interact with third-party services without storing the credentials of the person using the action.



## Create docker container actions

You'll learn about the basic components required to create and operate with packaged Docker containers. To keep this guide focused on the components required for packaging operations, the functionality of the operation code is minimal.



### Creating a Dockerfile

In the new `hello-world-docker-action` directory, create a new `Dockerfile` file. If you have problems, make sure the file name is capitalized correctly (use uppercase `D` instead of uppercase `f`).

```go
# Container image that runs your code
FROM alpine:3.10

# Copies your code file from your action repository to the filesystem path `/` of the container
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh

# Code file to execute when the docker container starts up (`entrypoint.sh`)
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
```



### Metadata actions syntax

All operations require a metadata file. The metadata file name must be `action.yml` or `action.yaml`. The data in the metadata file defines the input, output, and run configuration for your action.

+ name: **required**. The name of your operation. The `name` GitHub displays in the **Operations** tab to help visually identify the operations within each job.
+ description: *optional*. Provide a brief description of your action. GitHub will display this description on the action's details page.
+ author: *optional*. The author or organization name of the action.
+ inputs: *optional*. Define input parameters for the operation. Each input is a key-value pair, where the key is the parameter name and the value is the attribute describing the parameter. Attributes include `description`, `required` and `default`.
+ outputs: *optional*. Define the output parameters of the operation. Each output is a key-value pair, where the key is the parameter name and the value is the attribute describing the parameter. Attributes include `description` and `value`.
+ runs: **required**. Define the operation's run configuration. A run configuration specifies the operating system and environment in which the operation should run. Run configuration includes `using`, `image` and `args`.
+ branding: **OPTIONAL** You can create badges using colors and [Feathericons.com/] icons to personalize and differentiate your operations. The badge appears next to your action name in [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions).



**Specify input:**

```yaml
inputs:
   num-octocats:
     description: 'Number of Octocats'
     required: false
     default: '1'
   octocat-eye-color:
     description: 'Eye color of the Octocats'
     required: true
```

This example configures two inputs: `num-octocats` and `octocat-eye-color`. The input `num-octocats` is not required and has a default value of "1"; `octocat-eye-color` is required and has no default value. Workflow files that use this operation must use the `with` keyword to set the input value `octocat-eye-color`.

When you specify an input in a workflow file or use default input values, GitHub creates an environment variable named `INPUT_<VARIABLE_NAME>` for the input. The environment variable created converts the input name to uppercase letters and replaces spaces with `_` characters.

If the action is written using composite, it will not automatically get `INPUT_<VARIABLE_NAME>`. If no conversion occurs, you can change these inputs manually.

To access environment variables in a Docker container action, you must pass input using the `args` keyword in the action metadata file. For more information about the action metadata files for Docker container actions, see "[Creating a Docker Container Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container- action#creating-an-action-metadata-file)".

For example, if the workflow defines `num-octocats` and input, the action code can use the and environment variable `octocat-eye-color` to read the input value. `INPUT_NUM-OCTOCATS INPUT_OCTOCAT-EYE-COLOR`



**parameter**:

+ `inputs.<input_id>`: **Required** `string` The identifier associated with the input. The value of `<input_id>` is a mapping of input metadata. `<input_id>` must be a unique identifier within the object `inputs`. `<input_id>` must start with the letters or, `_` and contain only alphanumeric characters ,`-` or `_`.

+ `inputs.<input_id>.description` : **Required** `string` description of the input parameter.

- `inputs.<input_id>.required`: Indicates whether the input parameter is required. If true, the value of the input parameter must be provided when running the workflow, otherwise the workflow will fail.
- `inputs.<input_id>.default`: Represents the default value of the input parameter, which is used if the value of the input parameter is not provided when running the workflow.
- `inputs.<input_id>.env`: Indicates that the value of the input parameter is passed to the step in the workflow as an environment variable. For example, you can use `${{ env.INPUT_NAME }}` to reference the value of the input parameter in the step.
- `inputs.<input_id>.group`: Indicates grouping the input parameters. Multiple input parameters can be grouped into the same group to better organize and display them.





### Create operation metadata file

Create a new `action.yml` file in the `hello-world-docker-action` directory created above.

```yaml
#action.yml
name: 'Hello World'
description: 'Greet someone and record the time'
inputs:
   who-to-greet: # id of input
     description: 'Who to greet'
     required: true
     default: 'World'
outputs:
   time: #id of output
     description: 'The time we greeted you'
runs:
   using: 'docker'
   image: 'Dockerfile'
   args:
     - ${{ inputs.who-to-greet }}
```

This metadata defines a `who-to-greet` input and a `time` output parameter. To pass inputs to a Docker container, you should declare the inputs using `inputs` and pass the inputs in the `args` keyword. Everything you include in `args` will be passed to the container, but to allow users to better discover your actions, we recommend using inputs.

GitHub will build an image from your Dockerfile and use this image to run commands in the new container.



### Write operation code

You can choose any base Docker image, and therefore, your operations can be in any language. The following shell script example uses the `who-to-greet` input variable to print "Hello [who-to-greet]" in a log file.

Next, the script gets the current time and sets it as an output variable that can be used by operations that run later in the job. In order for GitHub to recognize output variables, you must write them to the `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` environment file: `echo "<output name>=<value>" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT` . For more information, see "How GitHub Actions Work" stream command."

1. Create a new `entrypoint.sh` file in the `hello-world-docker-action` directory.

2. Add the following code to the `entrypoint.sh` file.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/sh -l
   
    echo "Hello $1"
    time=$(date)
    echo "time=$time" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    ```

    > If `entrypoint.sh` executes without any errors, the operation's status is set to `success` . You can also set the exit code explicitly in the operation code to provide the status of the operation. For more information, see "Set the exit code for an operation."

3. Make your `entrypoint.sh` file executable. Git provides a way to explicitly change the permission mode of a file so that it doesn't get reset every time there is a clone/fork.

    ```bash
    $ git add entrypoint.sh
    $ git update-index --chmod=+x entrypoint.sh
    ```

4. Optionally, to check the permission mode of files in the git index, run the following command.

    ```bash
    $ git ls-files --stage entrypoint.sh
    ```





## Test your actions in a workflow

Now you are ready to test your actions in the workflow.

- Public actions can be used by workflows in any repository.

The following workflow code uses the completed hello world action from the public `actions/hello-world-docker-action` repository. Copy the following workflow example code into the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file, but replace `actions/hello-world-docker-action` with your repository and action names. You can also replace the `who-to-greet` input with your name. Public actions are available even if they are not published to GitHub Marketplace. For more information, see "Publish actions in GitHub Marketplace."

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
   hello_world_job:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     name: A job to say hello
     steps:
       - name: Hello world action step
         ID: hello
         uses: actions/hello-world-docker-action@v2
         with:
           who-to-greet: 'Mona the Octocat'
       # Use the output from the `hello` step
       - name: Get the output time
         run: echo "The time was ${{ steps.hello.outputs.time }}"

```

From the repository, click the Actions tab and select the latest workflow run. Under Assignments or in the visualization, click Assignments to say hello.

Click the Hello world step and you should see "Hello Mona the Octocat" or the name you used for the `who-to-greet` input printed in the log. Click Get output time to view the timestamp.





## Use workflow

[GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) is a central place where you can find actions created by the GitHub community. The GitHub Marketplace page allows you to filter actions by category.

The actions you use in your workflow can be defined in:

-Same repository as workflow files
- any public repository
- Docker container images published on Docker Hub



### Browse Marketplace actions in the workflow editor

You can search and browse actions directly in the repository's workflow editor. From the sidebar, you can search for specific actions, view featured actions, and browse featured categories. You can also view the number of stars an action has received from the GitHub community.

1. In the repository, browse to the workflow file that you want to edit.
2. In the upper right corner of the file view, to open the workflow editor, click
3. On the right side of the editor, use the GitHub Marketplace sidebar to browse operations. The badge indicates that GitHub has verified the creator of the action as a partner organization.



### Add operations to workflow Add operations to workflow

Actions can be added to a workflow by referencing the actions in the workflow file.

You can view actions referenced in a GitHub Actions workflow as dependencies in the dependency graph of the repository containing the workflow. For more information, see "[About the dependency graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the- dependency-graph)".



### Add actions from GitHub Marketplace

The action's list page includes the action's version and the workflow syntax required to use the action.
To keep your workflow stable even if updates are made to the operation, you can reference the version of the operation you want to use by specifying a Git or Docker tag number in the workflow file.

1. Navigate to the action you want to use in the workflow.

2. Click to see the full market list of operations.

3. Under Installation, click Copy workflow syntax.

    ![Screenshot of the marketplace listing for an action. The "Copy to clipboard" icon for the action is highlighted with a dark orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-52866/images/help /repository/actions-sidebar-detailed-view.png)

4. Paste the syntax as a new step in the workflow. For more information, see "[Workflow Syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps). "

5. If the action requires input from you, set them up in the workflow. For information about the inputs that actions may require, see "[Finding and customizing actions"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions#using -inputs-and-outputs-with-an-action). "

You can also enable Dependabot version updates for actions added to your workflow. For more information, see "[Keeping your actions up to date with Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/keeping-your-actions-up-to -date-with-dependabot)."



### Add operations from the same repository

If the action is defined in the same repository where the workflow file uses the action, it can be referenced in the workflow file using `{owner}/{repo}@{ref}` or `./path/to/dir` syntax operate.

Repository file structure example:

```
|-- hello-world (repository)
| |__ .github
| └── workflows
| └── my-first-workflow.yml
| └── actions
| |__ hello-world-action
| └── action.yml
```

Workflow file example:

```yaml
jobs:
   build:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       # This step checks out a copy of your repository.
       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       # This step references the directory that contains the action.
       - uses: ./.github/actions/hello-world-action
```

The `action.yml` file is used to provide metadata for actions. In "[Metadata syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)."



### Add actions from other repositories

If an action is defined in a different repository than the workflow file, the action can be referenced in the workflow file using the `{owner}/{repo}@{ref}` syntax.

Operations must be defined in a public repository.

```yaml
jobs:
   my_first_job:
     steps:
       - name: My first step
         uses: actions/setup-node@v3
```



### Reference the container on Docker Hub

If an action is defined in a Docker container image published on Docker Hub, the action must be referenced in the workflow file using the `docker://{image}:{tag}` syntax. To protect your code and data, we strongly recommend that you verify the integrity of a Docker container image from Docker Hub before using it in your workflow.

```yaml
jobs:
   my_first_job:
     steps:
       - name: My first step
         uses: docker://alpine:3.8
```

For some examples of Docker actions, see [Docker-image.yml workflow](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/docker-image.yml) and "[Creating a Docker Container Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action)."



## Basic characteristics of action

GitHub Actions allows you to customize workflows to meet the unique needs of your application and team. Such as using variables, running scripts, and sharing data and artifacts between jobs.



### Using variables in workflow

GitHub Actions includes default environment variables for each workflow run. If you need to use custom environment variables, you can set these variables in the YAML workflow file. This example demonstrates how to create custom variables named `POSTGRES_HOST` and `POSTGRES_PORT`. These variables are then available to the `node client.js` script.

```yaml
jobs:
   example-job:
       steps:
         - name: Connect to PostgreSQL
           run: node client.js
           env:
             POSTGRES_HOST: postgres
             POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
```



### Add script to workflow

You can use actions to run scripts and shell commands and then execute those commands on the assigned runner. This example demonstrates how an action can use the `run` keyword to execute `npm install -g bats` on the runner.

```yaml
jobs:
   example-job:
     steps:
       - run: npm install -g bats
```

For example, to run a script as an action, you can store the script in a repository and provide the path and shell type.

```yaml
jobs:
   example-job:
     steps:
       - name: Run build script
         run: ./.github/scripts/build.sh
         shell: bash
```

For more information, see "[Workflow Syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsrun)."



### Share data between jobs

If your job generates files that you want to share with another job in the same workflow, or you want to save these files for later reference, you can store them as artifacts in GitHub. Artifacts are files created when code is built and tested. For example, artifacts might include binary or package files, test results, screenshots, or log files. Artifacts are associated with the workflow run that created them and can be used by other jobs. All operations and workflows invoked within a run have write access to the run's artifacts.

For example, you can create a file and then upload it as an artifact.

```yaml
jobs:
   example-job:
     name: Save output
     steps:
       - shell: bash
         run: |
           expr 1 + 1 > output.log
       - name: Upload output file
         uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
         with:
           name: output-log-file
           path: output.log
```

To download artifacts from a separate workflow run, you can use the `actions/download-artifact` action. For example, you can download an artifact named `output-log-file`.

```yaml
jobs:
   example-job:
     steps:
       - name: Download a single artifact
         uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
         with:
           name: output-log-file
```

To download artifacts from the same workflow run, your download job should specify `needs: upload-job-name` so that it does not start until the upload job completes.

For more information about artifacts, see "[Storing Workflow Data as Artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts)."



## context

Context, what does the context in github actions look like?

Context is a way to access information about a workflow run, variables, runner environment, jobs, and steps. Each context is an object containing properties, which can be strings or other objects.

Contexts, objects, and properties can vary significantly under different workflow running conditions. For example, the `matrix` context is populated only for jobs in the matrix.

It may still not be clear, let’s look directly at when to use context:

GitHub Actions contains a variable collection called context and a similar variable collection called default variables. These variables are used at different points in the workflow:

+ Default environment variables: These environment variables only exist on the runner that executes the job. For more information, see "Variables."
+ Context: You can use most contexts at any time in the workflow, including when default variables are not available. For example, you can use a context with an expression to perform initial processing before routing the job to the runner for execution; this allows you to use a context with the conditional `if` keyword to determine whether a certain step should be run. Once the job starts running, you can also retrieve context variables from the runner that is executing the job, such as `runner.os` . For more information about where various contexts can be used in workflows, see "Contexts."

The following example demonstrates how to use these different types of variables together in a job:

```yaml
name: CI
on: push
jobs:
   prod-check:
     if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - run: echo "Deploying to production server on branch $GITHUB_REF"
```

In this example, the `if` statement checks the `github.ref` context to determine the current branch name; if the name is `refs/heads/main` , subsequent steps are performed. The `if` check is handled by GitHub Actions, and the job will be sent to the runner only if the result is `true`. This step is executed once the job is sent to the runner, referencing the `$GITHUB_REF` variable from the runner.



### Context availability

Different contexts can be used throughout a workflow run. For example, the `secrets` context can be used only at certain locations within the job.

Additionally, some features may only be available in certain locations. For example, the `hashFiles` function is not available everywhere.

## actions advanced functions

This section briefly introduces some of the advanced features of GitHub Actions to help you create more complex workflows.



### Save secret

*If your workflow uses sensitive data (such as passwords or certificates), you can save this data as secrets* in GitHub and then use them as environment variables in your workflow. This means you'll be able to create and share workflows without embedding sensitive values directly into the workflow's YAML source.

This sample job demonstrates how to reference an existing key as an environment variable and send it as an argument to a sample command.

```yaml
jobs:
   example-job:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - name: Retrieve secret
         env:
           super_secret: ${{ secrets.SUPERSECRET }}
         run: |
           example-command "$super_secret"
```



### Create dependency work

By default, jobs in a workflow all run simultaneously **in parallel**. If your job must run only after another job completes, you can create this dependency using the keyword `needs`. If one of the jobs fails, all related jobs are skipped; however, if you need to continue the job, you can define this using an `if` conditional statement.

In this example, `setup`, `build`, and `test` jobs run in series, and `build` depends on `test` on whether the job before them completes successfully:

```yaml
jobs:
   setup:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - run: ./setup_server.sh
   build:
     needs: setup
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - run: ./build_server.sh
   test:
     needs: build
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - run: ./test_server.sh
```

For more information, see "[Using jobs in workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-jobs-in-a-workflow#defining-prerequisite-jobs)”.



### Using matrix

Matrix strategies allow you to use variables in a single job definition to automatically create multiple job runs based on combinations of variables. For example, you can use a matrix strategy to test your code on multiple versions of a language or on multiple operating systems. The matrix is created using the `strategy` keyword, which receives the build options as an array. For example, this matrix will run a job multiple times using different versions of Node.js:

```yaml
jobs:
   build:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     strategy:
       matrix:
         node: [12, 14, 16]
     steps:
       - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
         with:
           node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
```

For more information, see "[Using a matrix for your jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs)".


### Caching dependencies

If your jobs frequently reuse dependencies, you may consider caching these files to help improve performance. Once a cache is created, it is available to all workflows in the same repository.

This example demonstrates how to cache the `~/.npm` directory:

```yaml
jobs:
   example-job:
     steps:
       - name: Cache node modules
         uses: actions/cache@v3
         env:
           cache-name: cache-node-modules
         with:
           path: ~/.npm
           key: ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
           restore-keys: |
             ${{ runner.os }}-build-${{ env.cache-name }}-
```

For more information, see "Caching dependencies to speed up workflows".



### Using database and service containers

If your job requires database or caching services, you can create them using the keyword [`services`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/running-jobs-in-a-container) A temporary container to host the service; the resulting container is then available for all steps in the job and is deleted when the job completes. This example demonstrates how a job can be used in `services` to create a `postgres` container, which is then used in `node` to connect to the service.

```yaml
jobs:
   container-job:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     container: node:10.18-jessie
     services:
       postgres:
         image: postgres
     steps:
       - name: Check out repository code
         uses: actions/checkout@v3
       - name: Install dependencies
         run: npm ci
       - name: Connect to PostgreSQL
         run: node client.js
         env:
           POSTGRES_HOST: postgres
           POSTGRES_PORT: 5432
```

For more information, see "[Using containerized services](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-containerized-services)".



### Use tags to route workflows

If you want to ensure that a specific type of runner will process your job, you can use tags to control where the job executes. In addition to the default label, you can assign the label `self-hosted` to a self-hosted runner. You can then reference these tags in YAML workflows to ensure jobs are routed predictably. GitHub-hosted runners have predefined tags assigned to them.

This example shows how a workflow can use labels to specify the required runners:

```yaml
jobs:
   example-job:
     runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64, gpu]
```

The workflow will only run on runners with all tags in the `runs-on` array. The job will be given priority to an idle self-hosted runner with the specified label. If no GitHub managed runner is available and exists with the specified label, the job will go to the GitHub managed runner.

To learn more about self-hosted runners tags, see "[Using tags with self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/ managing-self-hosted-runners/using-labels-with-self-hosted-runners)”.

To learn more about the GitHub Hosted Runners tag, see "[About GitHub Hosted Runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about- github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources)".

### Reuse workflows

You can call one workflow from another. This allows you to reuse workflows, avoid duplication and make workflows easier to maintain. For more information, see "[Reusing Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)".

### Usage environment

You can configure your environment with protection rules and secrets to control the execution of jobs in your workflow. Each job in a workflow can reference a single environment. Any protection rules configured for the environment must pass before a job that references the environment is sent to the runner. For more information, see "[Using Deployment Environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)".



## Concurrent work

You can use it `jobs.<job_id>.concurrency` to ensure that only one job or workflow using the same concurrency group is running at a time. A concurrency group can be any string or expression. Allowed expression contexts: [`github`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context), [`inputs`](https://docs .github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#inputs-context), [`vars`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts# vars-context), [`needs`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#needs-context), [`strategy`](https://docs. github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#strategy-context) and [`matrix`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#matrix -context). For more information about expressions, see "[Expressions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions)".

You can also specify concurrency at the workflow level. See [`concurrency`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency) for details.

When a concurrent job or workflow is queued, if another job or workflow using the same concurrency group in the repository is in progress, the queued job or workflow will be `pending`. Any previously suspended jobs or workflows in the concurrent group will be cancelled. To also cancel any currently running jobs or workflows in the same concurrency group, specify `cancel-in-progress: true`.

### Example: Using concurrency and default behavior

```yaml
concurrency: staging_environment
concurrency: ci-${{ github.ref }}
```

### Example: Cancel any in-progress job or run using concurrency

```yaml
concurrency:
   group: ${{ github.ref }}
   cancel-in-progress: true
```



## Run in container

Use `jobs.<job_id>.container` to create a container to run any steps in the job that do not already have a container specified. If you have steps that use both a script and a container action, the container action will run as a sibling container on the same network with the same volume mount.

If you do not set a `container`, all steps will run directly on the specified host `runs-on` unless the step references an operation configured to run in a container.

Case:

```yaml
name: CI
on:
   push:
     branches: [main]
jobs:
   container-test-job:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     container:
       image: node:14.16
       env:
         NODE_ENV: development
       ports:
         - 80
       volumes:
         - my_docker_volume:/volume_mount
       options: --cpus 1
     steps:
       - name: Check for dockerenv file
         run: (ls /.dockerenv && echo Found dockerenv) || (echo No dockerenv)
```

The `image` keyword can be omitted when you specify only the container image.

```yaml
jobs:
   container-test-job:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     container: node:14.16
```



## Define container image

for `jobs.<job_id>.container.image` defines the Docker image used as the container to run the operation. The value can be a Docker Hub image name or a registry name.

If the image's container registry requires authentication to pull the image, you can use the and `jobs.<job_id>.container.credentials` settings. The credentials are the same values you provide to the command.

map username password [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/)



## Use environment variables with containers

Used to set a series of environment variables in the container `jobs.<job_id>.container.env`. `map`



**Mount the volume in the container:**

Used in `jobs.<job_id>.container.volumes` to set the volumes used by the `array` container. You can use volumes to share data between services or other steps in a job. You can specify named Docker volumes, anonymous Docker volumes, or bind mounts on the host.

To specify a volume, specify the source and destination paths:

`<source>:<destinationPath>`.

is the volume name or absolute path on the host and <destinationPath> is the absolute path in the container.



### Example: Mount a volume in a container

```yaml
volumes:
   - my_docker_volume:/volume_mount
   -/data/my_data
   - /source/directory:/destination/directory
```



## Define default settings that will apply to all jobs in a workflow or all steps in a job

When multiple defaults are defined with the same name, GitHub will use the most specific default. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting with the same name defined in a workflow.



### Set default shell and working directory

Use `jobs.<job_id>.defaults` to create a `map` with default settings that will be applied to all steps in the job. You can also set default settings for your entire workflow. See `defaults` https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#defaults for details.

When multiple defaults are defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting of the same name defined in a workflow.



### Set the default shell and working directory of the job

Used in `jobs.<job_id>.defaults.run` to provide default values for all `run` steps in the `shell` `working-directory` in a job. Contexts and expressions are not allowed in this section.

The default `shell` and `working-directory` options `run` can be provided for all steps in a job. It is also possible to `run` to set default settings for the entire workflow. See `jobs.defaults.run` for details. You cannot use context or expressions in this keyword.

When multiple defaults are defined with the same name, GitHub uses the most specific default. For example, a default setting defined in a job will override a default setting of the same name defined in a workflow.



### Set the default step options for `run` jobs

```yaml
jobs:
   job1:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     defaults:
       run:
         shell: bash
         working-directory: scripts
```



## Assign permissions to jobs

You can use `permissions` to modify the default permissions granted by `GITHUB_TOKEN`, adding or removing access rights as needed so that only the minimum required access is allowed. For more information, see "[Automatic token authentication.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token)"

You can use this as the `permissions` top-level keyword to apply to all jobs in a workflow or to jobs within a specific job. When you add a `permissions` key in a specific job, all operations and run commands used in that job will get the `GITHUB_TOKEN` access you specify. See `jobs.<job_id>.permissions` for details.

Available scopes and access values:

```yaml
permissions:
   actions: read|write|none
   checks: read|write|none
   contents: read|write|none
   deployments: read|write|none
   id-token: read|write|none
   issues: read|write|none
   discussions: read|write|none
   packages: read|write|none
   pages: read|write|none
   pull-requests: read|write|none
   repository-projects: read|write|none
   security-events: read|write|none
   statuses: read|write|none
```

If access is specified for any of these scopes, all unspecified scopes will be set to `none` .

Read or write access to all available scopes can be defined using the following syntax:

```yaml
permissions: read-all|write-all
```

Permissions can be disabled for all available scopes using the following syntax:

```yaml
permissions: {}
```

You can use this key to add and remove read permissions for the derived repository, but generally cannot grant write permissions. `permissions` key to add and remove read permissions for forked repositories, but typically you can't grant write access. The exception to this behavior is for admin users who have selected "Send write permissions from pull requests" in GitHub Actions settings Cards to Workflow” option. For more information, see "Manage GitHub Action Settings for a Repository."



### Assign permissions to GITHUB_TOKEN

This example shows permissions set that will apply to all jobs in the workflow. `GITHUB_TOKEN` This will apply to all jobs in the workflow. All permissions are granted read access.

```go
name: "My workflow"

on: [push]

permissions: read-all

jobs:
   ...
```



### Example: Setting permissions for a specific job

This example shows the permissions set, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` permission only applies to jobs named `stale` . and the scope is granted write access to `issues` `pull-requests` . All other scopes have no access.

```yaml
jobs:
   stale:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

     permissions:
       issues: write
       pull-requests: write

     steps:
       - uses: actions/stale@v5
```



## Build and Test (CI)

**About Continuous Integration (CI):**

We have heard the name CICD many times, which stands for *Continuous Integration* and *Continuous Deployment*

Continuous integration (CI) is a software practice that requires frequent code commits to a shared repository. Committing code more frequently can detect bugs faster and reduce the amount of code developers need to debug while finding the source of the bug.

Frequent code updates also make it easier to incorporate changes from different members of the software development team. This is great for developers, who can spend more time writing code and less time debugging errors or resolving merge conflicts.

When you commit code to a repository, you can continually build and test the code to ensure your commits don't introduce bugs.

Testing can include code linking (checking style formatting), security checks, code coverage, functional tests, and other custom checks.

A server is required to build and test your code. You can build and test updates locally before pushing the code to the repository, or you can use a CI server to check the repository for new code commits.



### About using GitHub Actions for continuous integration

You can configure your CI workflow to run when a GitHub event occurs (for example, when new code is pushed to the repository), on a set schedule, or use a repository scheduling webhook to run when an external event occurs.

GitHub runs CI tests and provides the results of each test in pull requests, so you can see if changes in your branch introduced bugs. When all configuration item tests in the workflow pass, the changes you push can be reviewed or merged by team members.

When a test fails, it's likely that one of your changes caused the failure.

When you set up CI in a repository, GitHub analyzes the code in the repository and recommends CI workflows based on the languages and frameworks in the repository. For example, if you use Node.js, GitHub will suggest a startup workflow for installing Node.js packages and running tests. You can use GitHub's suggested CI starter workflow, customize the suggested starter workflow, or create your own custom workflow file to run CI tests.

In addition to helping you set up CI workflows for your projects, you can use GitHub Actions to create workflows throughout the software development lifecycle. For example, you can use actions to deploy, package, or publish a project. For more information, see "[Learn GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions)."



## Starter workflow

GitHub provides CI startup workflows for various languages and frameworks.

Browse the full list of CI starter workflows provided by GitHub in the [actions/starter-workflow](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/tree/main/ci) repository.



## About continuous deployment (CD)

Continuous deployment (CD) is the practice of using automation to release and deploy software updates. As part of a typical CD process, code is automatically built and tested before deployment.

You can set up GitHub Actions workflows to deploy your software products. To verify that the product works as expected, your workflow can build the code in the repository and run tests before deploying.

You can configure a CD workflow to run when a GitHub event occurs (for example, when new code is pushed to the repository's default branch), on a set schedule, manually, or when an external event occurs using a repository scheduling webhook.

*Next let’s learn to use github’s actions for continuous deployment:*

GitHub Actions provides features that allow you to control deployment. you can:

- Use various events to trigger workflows.
- Configure the environment to set rules and restrict access to secrets before the job continues.
- Use concurrency to control the number of deployments running at one time.



### Trigger deployment

You can use various events to trigger deployment workflows. The most common ones are: `pull_request`, `push` and `workflow_dispatch`.

+ There is a thrust on the branch `main` .
+ Pull requests targeting branch `main` are opened, synced or reopened.
+ Someone triggered it manually.

```yaml
on:
   push:
     branches:
       - main
   pull_request:branches:
       - main
   workflow_dispatch:
```



### Use concurrency

Concurrency ensures that only a single job or workflow using the same concurrency group runs at a time. You can use concurrency so that there is at most one ongoing deployment and one pending deployment in the environment at a time.

For example, when the following workflow runs, `pending` will be paused with a status of `production` if any jobs or workflows using the concurrent group `production` are in progress. It will also cancel any jobs or workflows that use the concurrency group and have status `production` , `pending` . This means that a job or workflow using a concurrency group can only have at most one running and one pending in `production`.

```yaml
name: Deployment

concurrency: production

on:
   push:
     branches:
       - main

jobs:
   deployment:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     environment: production
     steps:
       - name: deploy
         # ...deployment-specific steps
```

You can also specify concurrency at the job level. This will allow other jobs in the workflow to continue, even if concurrent jobs are `pending` .

```yaml
name: Deployment

on:
   push:
     branches:
       - main

jobs:
   deployment:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     environment: production
     concurrency: production
     steps:
       - name: deploy
         # ...deployment-specific steps
```



### Choosing a runner

You can run deployment workflows on GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runners. Traffic from GitHub-hosted runners may originate from a variety of network addresses. If you are deploying to an on-premises environment and your company restricts external traffic to a private network, GitHub Actions workflows running on GitHub-hosted runners may not be able to communicate with your internal services or resources.



## About packaging with GitHub Actions

The packaging step is a common part of a continuous integration or continuous delivery workflow. Creating a package at the end of a continuous integration workflow can help during code review of a pull request.

After the code is built and tested, the packaging step can produce runnable or deployable artifacts. Depending on the type of application you are building, this package can be downloaded locally for manual testing, available for users to download, or deployed to a staging or production environment.

For example, a continuous integration workflow for a Java project might run `mvn package` to generate a JAR file. Alternatively, a CI workflow for a Node.js application might create a Docker container.

Now, when viewing a pull request, you will be able to view the workflow run and download the resulting artifacts.

![Screenshot of the "Artifacts" portion of the workflow run. The name "Artifact" of the artifact generated by the run is highlighted with a dark orange outline. ](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-13991/images/help/repository/artifact-drop-down-updated.png)



### Workflow of publishing packages

In addition to uploading packaging artifacts for testing in a continuous integration workflow, you can create a workflow that builds the project and publishes the package to the package registry.

- **Publish packages to GitHub Packages** GitHub Packages can act as a package hosting service for many types of packages. You can choose to share your package with all of GitHub, or share a private package with collaborators or organizations. For more information, see "[Introduction to GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages)".

   You may want to publish your package to GitHub Packages every time you push to the default branch. This will allow a project's developers to always easily run and test the latest version of the default branch by installing it from GitHub Packages.

- **Publish a package to the package registry** For many projects, a publish to the package registry is performed whenever a new version of the project is published. For example, a project that generates a JAR file can upload new versions to the Maven central repository. Alternatively, a .NET project might generate a nuget package and upload it to the NuGet Gallery.

   You can automate this by creating a workflow that publishes the package to the package registry each time a version is created. For more information, see "[Managing releases in a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)".



### Publish Docker image

You can trigger a workflow to publish an image every time you create a new version on GitHub. The workflow in the following example runs `created` when an event of activity type `release` is fired. For more information about the `release` event, see "[Events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#release)" .

In the example workflow below, we use the Docker `login-action` and `build-push-action` actions to build a Docker image and, if the build is successful, push the built image to Docker Hub.

To push to Docker Hub, you need to have a Docker Hub account and create a Docker Hub repository. For more information, see "Pushing Docker container images to Docker Hub" in the Docker documentation. ](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#pushing-a-docker-container-image-to-docker-hub)

`login-action` The required options for Docker Hub are:

- `username` and `password`: These are your Docker Hub username and password. We recommend storing your Docker Hub username and password as secret so they are not exposed in your workflow files. For more information, see "[Encrypted Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)".

`metadata-action` The required options for Docker Hub are:

- `images`: The namespace and name of the Docker image you are building/pushing to Docker Hub.

`build-push-action` The required options for Docker Hub are:

- `tags`: Tags for new image format `DOCKER-HUB-NAMESPACE/DOCKER-HUB-REPOSITORY:VERSION`. You can set a single label as shown below, or specify multiple labels in a list.
- `push`: If set to `true`, the image will be pushed to the registry after it is successfully built.

```yaml
name: Publish Docker image

on:
   release:
     types: [published]

jobs:
   push_to_registry:
     name: Push Docker image to Docker Hub
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - name: Check out the repo
         uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
       - name: Log in to Docker Hub
         uses: docker/login-action@f4ef78c080cd8ba55a85445d5b36e214a81df20a
         with:
           username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
           password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
      
       - name: Extract metadata (tags, labels) for Docker
         id:meta
         uses: docker/metadata-action@9ec57ed1fcdbf14dcef7dfbe97b2010124a938b7
         with:
           images: my-docker-hub-namespace/my-docker-hub-repository
      
       - name: Build and push Docker image
         uses: docker/build-push-action@3b5e8027fcad23fda98b2e3ac259d8d67585f671
         with:
           context: .
           file: ./Dockerfile
           push: true
           tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
           labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
```

The workflow above checks the GitHub repository, logs into the registry using `login-action`, and then uses the action `build-push-action` to: Build a Docker image `Dockerfile` based on the repository; push the image to Docker Hub, And apply tags to the image.



### Publish the image to a GitHub package

You can trigger a workflow to publish an image every time you create a new version on GitHub. The workflow in the following example runs `created` when an event of activity type `release` is fired. For more information about the `release` event, see "[Events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#release)" .

In the example workflow below, we use the Docker `login-action`, `metadata-action`, and `build-push-action` actions to build a Docker image and, if the build is successful, push the built image to GitHub Packages.

The options required by the `login-action` GitHub package are:

- `registry`: must be set to `ghcr.io`.
- `username`: You can use the `${{ github.actor }}` context to automatically use the username of the user who triggered the workflow to run. See "[Context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context)" for details.
- `password`: You can use the automatically generated `GITHUB_TOKEN` password as the password. For more information, see "[Automated Token AuthenticationAuthentication](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication)".

The required options for `metadata-action` GitHub Packages are:

- `images`: The namespace and name of the Docker image you are building.

The options required by the `build-push-action` GitHub package are:

- `context`: Defines the build context as the set of files located in the specified path.
- `push`: If set to `true`, the image will be pushed to the registry after it is successfully built.
- `tags` and `labels`: These are populated by the output of `metadata-action`.

```yaml
# GitHub recommends pinning actions to a commit SHA.
# To get a newer version, you will need to update the SHA.
# You can also reference a tag or branch, but the action may change without warning.

name: Create and publish a Docker image

on:
   push:
     branches: ['release']

env:
   REGISTRY: ghcr.io
   IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}

jobs:
   build-and-push-image:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     permissions:

     steps:
       - name: Checkout repository
         uses: actions/checkout@v3

       - name: Log in to the Container registry
         uses: docker/login-action@65b78e6e13532edd9afa3aa52ac7964289d1a9c1
         with:
           registry: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}
           username: ${{ github.actor }}
           password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

       - name: Extract metadata (tags, labels) for Docker
         id:meta
         uses: docker/metadata-action@9ec57ed1fcdbf14dcef7dfbe97b2010124a938b7
         with:
           images: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}

       - name: Build and push Docker image
         uses: docker/build-push-action@f2a1d5e99d037542a71f64918e516c093c6f3fc4
         with:
           context: .
           push: true
           tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
           labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
```



### Publish images to Docker Hub and GitHub packages

Within a single workflow, you can publish a Docker image to multiple registries by using `login-action` and actions on each registry. `build-push-action`

The following example workflow uses the previous section ("[Publishing images to Docker Hub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images#publishing-images-to-docker- hub)" and "[Publishing images to GitHub packages](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images#publishing-images-to-github-packages)") Follow the steps in to create a single workflow that pushes to both registries.

```yaml
# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# GitHub recommends pinning actions to a commit SHA.
# To get a newer version, you will need to update the SHA.
# You can also reference a tag or branch, but the action may change without warning.

name: Publish Docker image

   release:
     types: [published]

jobs:
   push_to_registries:
     name: Push Docker image to multiple registries
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     permissions:

           tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
           labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
```



## project management

You can use GitHub Actions to automate project management tasks by creating workflows. Each workflow contains a series of tasks that are executed automatically each time the workflow runs. For example, you can create a workflow that runs every time an issue is created to add tags, leave comments, and move the issue to the project board.



### Add labels

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the [`actions/github-script` action in the workflow to mark newly opened or reopened issues. ](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-script) For example, you can `triage` to add a tag every time you open or reopen an issue. You can then view all questions that need triage by filtering questions with the label `triage`.

The `actions/github-script` action allows you to easily use the GitHub API in your workflow.

**Create Workflow:**

1. Select the repository to which you want to apply this project management workflow. You can use an existing repository with write permissions or create a new repository. For more information about creating a repository, see "[Creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)" .
2. In your repository, create a file named `.github/workflows/YOUR_WORKFLOW.yml` and replace `YOUR_WORKFLOW` with a name of your choice. This is a workflow document. For more information about creating new files on GitHub, see "[Creating new files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files )".

```yaml
name: Label issues
on:
   issues:
     types:
       - reopened
       -opened
jobs:
   label_issues:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     permissions:
       issues: write
     steps:
       - uses: actions/github-script@v6
         with:
           script: |
             github.rest.issues.addLabels({
               issue_number: context.issue.number,
               owner: context.repo.owner,
               repo: context.repo.repo,
               labels: ["triage"]
             })
```

3. Customize the parameters in the `script` workflow file:

- The value is automatically set using the object `issue_number`. You don't need to change these. `owner``repo``context`
- Change the value to `labels` for the list of labels to be added to the question. Separate multiple tags with commas. For example, `["help wanted", "good first issue"]`. For more information about labels, see "[Manage Labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and -milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests)”.

4. Commit the workflow files to the default branch of the repository. For more information, see "[Creating New Files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files)".



### Issues moving assignments on the project board

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the [`alex-page/github-project-automation-plus` action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-project-automation) to automatically move issues to A specific column on the project board. For example, after assigning an issue, you can move it to a column on the `In Progress` project board.

### Create workflow

1. Select the repository to which you want to apply this project management workflow. You can use an existing repository with write permissions or create a new repository. For more information about creating a repository, see "[Creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)" .
2. In your repository, select a project board. You can use an existing project or create a new one. For more information about creating projects, see "[Creating Projects (Classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/organizing-your-work-with-project-boards/managing-project-boards /creating-a-project-board)”.
3. In your repository, create a file named `.github/workflows/YOUR_WORKFLOW.yml` and replace `YOUR_WORKFLOW` with a name of your choice. This is a workflow document. For more information about creating new files on GitHub, see "[Creating new files](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/creating-new-files )".
4. Copy the following YAML content into your workflow file.

```yaml
# GitHub recommends pinning actions to a commit SHA.
# To get a newer version, you will need to update the SHA.
# You can also reference a tag or branch, but the action may change without warning.

name: Move assigned card
on:
   issues:
     types:
       -assigned
jobs:
   move-assigned-card:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - uses: alex-page/github-project-automation-plus@7ffb872c64bd809d23563a130a0a97d01dfa8f43
         with:
           project: Docs Work
           Column: In Progress
           repo-token: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

1. Customize the parameters in the workflow file:
    - Change the value of `project` to the name of your project board. If you have multiple project boards with the same name, this `alex-page/github-project-automation-plus` action will act on all projects with the specified name.
    - Change the value of `column` to the name of the column you wish to move the question to when assigning it.
    - Change the value of `repo-token`:
      1. Create a personal access token (classic) `repo` using scope. For more information, see "[Managing your personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access -token)".
      2. Store this personal access token as a secret in your repository. For more information about storing secrets, see "[Encrypted Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)".
      3. In your workflow file, replace `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your key name.
