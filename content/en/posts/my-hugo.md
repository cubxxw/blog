# Rebuild my blog (static)

The enemy is back...

It‚Äôs so difficult this time. When I was preparing my resume, I found that my blog was gone. My dearest blog [nsddd.top](nsddd.top), which I had accompanied for a year and was well-received, was sacrificed. Wuwuwuwu

Don't be impatient, don't be impatient, learn a lesson, what is the first thing? I will definitely not use dynamic blogs anymore. I used workpress for my first blog in my freshman year. The server management tool I used at that time was the famous Pagoda. Although I still don't use it now. I am using it, hahaha, but I will definitely never use it again in the future. Do you remember the second generation blog? The second generation blog is the blog I just sacrificed. It was built using docker and survived for two years (sophomore to junior year). The server was changed halfway through, but thanks to Docker‚Äôs elegant Portability haha, so my blog survives.

So why did it fail this time? ? ? The hanging date is September 1, 2023. The reason is that Java malfunctioned and it was found that the swtich space was insufficient. Then, I was ready to transplant and repair it, but I really felt that I couldn't maintain it. I hope that my blog can survive for a few years, more than ten years, or even decades or hundreds of years.

So, start from scratch!!!



## Choose a suitable blog template

I have used vuepress to take notes before, but vuepress is not particularly suitable for what I am doing now, because I am already visually exhausted, hahaha, and it is very uncomfortable to watch, so I used an open source project that I like very much, and many of you are familiar with it. Top open source project: hugo, GitHub address is: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo

The next step is to choose a suitable theme. I chose https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod based on several popular themes.

### Install Hugo

I am keen on source code. I can change the code and submit PR at any time, so I use the source code to build:

```bash
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/cubxxw/hugo.git
‚ùØ cd hugo
‚ùØ go build
‚ùØ mv hugo /usr/bin
```

### Deploy theme

Choose the theme we use:

```bash
‚ùØ git clone https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod themes/PaperMod --depth=1

# If you want to update the theme later
‚ùØ cd themes/PaperMod
‚ùØ git pull
```

**Use git [submodule](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-submodule) with**

> The code may be submitted to Github, so the git of external modules containing subprojects can be managed with git submodule.

```bash
‚ùØ git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod
‚ùØ git submodule update --init --recursive # needed when you reclone your repo (submodules may not get cloned automatically)
```

> **Note**: You may use ` --branch v7.0` to end of above command if you want to stick to specific release.

**Update theme using method 2**:

> ````bash
> ‚ùØ git submodule update --remote --merge
> ```



**Add theme to hugo.toml:**

It is recommended to use yaml or toml. I prefer to use yaml haha. Of course, you can use the tool https://tooltt.com/yaml2toml/ to convert it at will.

```toml
baseURL = 'https://nsddd.top'
languageCode = 'en-us'
title = 'cubxxw is blog'
theme = "PaperMod"

enableRobotsTXT = true
buildDrafts = false
buildFuture = false
buildExpired = false
googleAnalytics = "UA-123-45"
pygmentsUseClasses = true

[minify]
disableXML = true
minifyOutput = true

[params]
env = "production"
title = "ExampleSite"
description = "ExampleSite description"
keywords = [ "Blog", "Portfolio", "PaperMod" ]
author = "Me"
images = [ "<link or path of image for opengraph, twitter-cards>" ]
DateFormat = "January 2, 2006"

   safari_pinned_tab = "<link/abs url>"

   [params.label]

   iconHeight = 35

   [params.profileMode]
   enabled = false
   title = "ExampleSite"
   subtitle = "This is subtitle"
   imageUrl = "<img location>"
   imageWidth = 120
   imageHeight = 120
   imageTitle = "my image"

     [[params.profileMode.buttons]]
     name = "Posts"
     url = "posts"

     [[params.profileMode.buttons]]
     name = "Tags"
     url = "tags"

   [params.homeInfoParams]
   Title = "Hi there üëã"
   Content = "Welcome to my blog"

   [[params.socialIcons]]
   name = "twitter"
   url = "https://twitter.com/"

   [[params.socialIcons]]
   name = "stackoverflow"

   url = "https://github.com/"

[params.analytics.google]
SiteVerificationTag = "XYZabc"

[params.analytics.bing]
SiteVerificationTag = "XYZabc"

[params.analytics.yandex]
SiteVerificationTag = "XYZabc"

   [params.cover]
   hidden = true
   hiddenInList = true
   hiddenInSingle = true

   [params.editPost]
   URL = "https://github.com/<path_to_repo>/content"
   Text = "Suggest Changes"
   appendFilePath = true

   [params.fuseOpts]
   isCaseSensitive = false
   shouldSort = true
   location = 0
   distance = 1_000
   threshold = 0.4
   minMatchCharLength = 0
   keys = [ "title", "permalink", "summary", "content" ]

[[menu.main]]
identifier = "categories"
name = "categories"
url = "/categories/"
weight=10

[[menu.main]]
identifier = "tags"
name = "tags"
url = "/tags/"
weight=20

[[menu.main]]
identifier = "example"
name = "example.org"
url = "https://example.org"
weight=30

[markup.highlight]
noClasses = false
```



**Then create a file:**

> Sample `Page.md`

```markdown
---
title: "My 1st post"
date: 2020-09-15T11:30:03+00:00
# weight: 1
# aliases: ["/first"]
tags: ["first"]
author: "Me"
# author: ["Me", "You"] # multiple authors
showToc: true
TocOpen: false
draft: false
hidemeta: false
comments: false
description: "Desc Text."
canonicalURL: "https://canonical.url/to/page"
disableHLJS: true # to disable highlightjs
disableShare: false
disableHLJS: false
hideSummary: false
searchHidden: true
ShowReadingTime: true
ShowBreadCrumbs: true
ShowPostNavLinks: true
ShowWordCount: true
ShowRssButtonInSectionTermList: true
UseHugoToc: true
cover:
     image: "<image path/url>" # image path/url
     alt: "<alt text>" # alt text
     caption: "<text>" # display caption under cover
     relative: false # when using page bundles set this to true
     hidden: true # only hide on current single page
editPost:
     URL: "https://github.com/<path_to_repo>/content"
     Text: "Suggest Changes" # edit text
     appendFilePath: true # to append file path to Edit link
---
```

It can be used by creating `archetypes/post.md`

```bash
‚ùØ hugo new --kind post archetypes/Page.md
```



**All examples below use `yml/yaml` format, I recommend using `yml` instead of `toml` as it is easier to read. **

Of course, as a cloud-native configuration file, yaml is more loved by me than toml :love_letter:



### Basic commands of hugo

**Added content:**

You can use the `hugo new` command to add new content, for example:

```bash
‚ùØ hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

This command will generate the `content/posts/my-first-post.md` file,

Then, edit the `content/posts/my-first-post.md` file to add your content.



**Generate all content:**

```
‚ùØ hugo
```

> The above command will generate all pages and place them in the `public/` directory.



**You can use the `hugo server` command to preview your website locally:**

```bash
‚ùØ hugo server -D
```

The `-D` parameter means including draft content. Then, visit `http://localhost:1313` in your browser to view your site.



**Define path**

By default, the path is strongly related. For example, in which directory you define it, the path is the path of this directory, but this is not absolute.

For example, the above:

```bash
‚ùØ hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

The default access URL for this post will usually be:

+ http://localhost:1313/posts/my-first-post/

Note the following points:

1. **Ending Slash**: Hugo generates "pretty URLs" by default, which means they will end with a slash. You can modify this behavior in Hugo's configuration file.
2. **Draft and Publish**: Newly created posts are in draft status by default (`draft: false` in the header information of the post). If you use `hugo server` to preview your site without adding the `-D` parameter, you will not see the draft. In order to preview draft content, you need to use `hugo server -D`.
3. **Custom path**: If you want to define a custom path for a specific post, you can specify it using the `url` attribute in the front matter of the post.



## Theme configuration

In the next environment, we start our theme configuration. The configuration of the theme enriches hugo's theme.



###Default theme dark/light

```yaml
params:
     # defaultTheme: light
     # defaultTheme: dark
     defaultTheme: auto # to switch between dark or light according to browser theme
```



### Archives Layout

Create a page with `archive.md` in the `content` directory with the following content

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content/
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ archives.md <--- Create archive.md here
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ posts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ themes/
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PaperMod/
```

and add the following:

```bash
---
title: "Archive"
layout: "archives"
url: "/archives/"
summary: archives
---
```

NOTE: The **Archives** layout does not support multilingual month translations.



### start up

**Start using `hugo server`:**

```bash
‚ùØ hugo server
```

Then visit: http://localhost:1313/

![image-20230913222054387](http://sm.nsddd.top/sm202309132220842.png)

Click **Moon** to support setting **Light and Dark**.



### Normal mode (default mode)

Use the 1st entry as some information:

```yaml
   homeInfoParams:
     Title: Hi there üëã
     Content: My name is Xinwei(bear) Xiong. My loyalty is to adventure ü§ñ
   socialIcons:
     - name: twitter
       url: https://twitter.com/xxw3293172751
     - name: stackoverflow
       url: https://stackoverflow.com/users/17393425/xinwei-xiong

     - name: weibo
       url: https://weibo.com/u/6248930985
```

 

### Profile mode

Display Index/Home as a full page with social links and images

Add the following content to the configuration file:

```go
params:
     profileMode:
         enabled: true
         title: "<Title>" # optional default will be site title
         subtitle: "This is subtitle"
         imageUrl: "<image link>" # optional
         imageTitle: "<title of image as alt>" # optional
         imageWidth: 120 # custom size
         imageHeight: 120 # custom size
         buttons:
             - name: Archive
             url: "/archive"
             - name: Github
             url: "https://github.com/"

     socialIcons: #optional
         - name: "<platform>"
             url: "<link>"
         - name: "<platform 2>"
             url: "<link2>"
```



### BreadCrumb Navigation

Add BreadCrumb navigation above the article title to show subsections and home page navigation

```yaml
params:
     ShowBreadCrumbs: true
```

It is possible to disable the cover page for specific pages:

```yaml
---
ShowBreadCrumbs: false
---
```



### Edit post link

Adds a button that suggests changes by linking to the edit destination using the article's file path.

For site configuration purposes:

```yaml
Params:
     editPost:
         URL: "https://github.com/<gitlab user>/<repo name>/tree/<branch name>/<path to content>/"
         Text: "Suggest Changes" # edit text
         appendFilePath: true # to append file path to Edit link
```

Modifications can be made for individual pages:

```yaml
---
editPost:
     URL: "https://github.com/<path_to_repo>/content"
     Text: "Suggest Changes" # edit text
     appendFilePath: true # to append file path to Edit link
---
```

Of course, Makefile is for local. If it is a remote server, you need to rely on github actions:

``` bash
# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Hugo site to GitHub Pages

on:
   # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
   push:
     branches: ["main"]

   # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
   workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:

   id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.

## Comment plugin

To add a comment, create an html file

```bash
layouts/partials/comments.html
```

and paste the code provided by your review provider

Also add this in config

```yaml
params:
     comments: true
```

I use: https://utteranc.es/ This is a plugin based on GitHub comments



## multi-language

+ https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#menus

Hugo supports the simultaneous creation of websites in multiple languages.

`languages` should define the available languages in a section of the site configuration.

**Translate by file name**

1. `/content/about.en.md`
2. `/content/about.fr.md`

The first file is specified as English and linked to the second file. The second file is specified in French and linked to the first file.

Their language is specified based on the language code added as a suffix to the file name.

Content fragments are linked together as translated pages by having the same path and base filename.

> If the file does not have a language code, it will be assigned a default language.



**Translation by content directory**

Of course, you can also translate based on the file directory. The system uses a different content directory for each language. The content directory for each language is set using the `contentDir` parameter.

```yaml
languages:
   en:
     contentDir: content/english
     languageName: English
     weight: 10
   fr:
     contentDir: content/french
     languageName: Fran√ßais
     weight: 20
```

The value of `contentDir` can be any valid path - even an absolute path reference. The only restriction is that content directories cannot overlap.

The final example is as follows:

1. `/content/english/about.md`
2. `/content/french/about.md`

The first file is specified as English and linked to the second file. The second file is specified in French and linked to the first file.

Their language is specified based on the content directory in which they are located.

Content fragments are linked together as translation pages by having the same path and base name (relative to their language content directory).



**Bypass default link**

Any pages sharing the same `translationKey` set in the cover will be linked as the translated page, regardless of base name or location.

Consider the following example:

1. `/content/about-us.en.md`
2. `/content/om.nn.md`
3. `/content/presentation/a-propos.fr.md`

```yaml
translationKey: about
```

By setting the `translationKey` front matter parameter to `about` in all three pages, they will be linked as translation pages.



### Use `hugo new content` to generate multilingual content

**Given below are the translated files**:

For the same directory:

```bash
hugo new content posts/my-hugo.en.md
hugo new content posts/my-hugo.de.md
```

For different directories:

```bash
hugo new content content/en/posts/test.md
hugo new content content/de/posts/test.md
hugo new content content/zh/posts/test.md
hugo new content content/fr/posts/test.md
hugo new content content/es/posts/test.md
hugo new content content/zh-tw/posts/test.md
```

We add the following parameters to our configuration file:

```yaml
#config.yaml
languages:
   en:
     languageName: English
     weight: 1
   fr:
     languageName: Fran√ßais
     weight: 2
   es:
     languageName: Spanish
     weight: 3
```
